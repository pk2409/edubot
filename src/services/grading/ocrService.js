      `Question 1: What is photosynthesis?
Answer: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The chlorophyll in leaves captures sunlight and converts it into chemical energy. This process produces glucose and oxygen as byproducts.

Question 2: Explain the water cycle.
Answer: The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth. It includes evaporation from oceans and lakes, condensation in clouds, precipitation as rain or snow, and collection back into water bodies.

Question 3: Name three types of rocks.
Answer: The three main types of rocks are:
1. Igneous rocks - formed from cooled magma
2. Sedimentary rocks - formed from compressed sediments  
3. Metamorphic rocks - formed from heat and pressure`,

      `Question 1: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15
Answer: 2x + 5 = 15
2x = 15 - 5
2x = 10
x = 5

Question 2: What is the area of a rectangle with length 8cm and width 6cm?
Answer: Area = length × width
Area = 8 × 6 = 48 cm²

Question 3: Find the perimeter of a triangle with sides 3cm, 4cm, and 5cm.
Answer: Perimeter = sum of all sides
Perimeter = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 cm`,

      `Question 1: Who was the first President of India?
Answer: Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the first President of India. He served from 1950 to 1962 and played an important role in the Indian independence movement.
